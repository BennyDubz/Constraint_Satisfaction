# Constraint_Satisfaction
Implementation of a generalized Constraint Satisfaction Problem, alongside a backtracking solver with MAC, min-remaining-value, and least-constraining-value heuristics. Applied to map coloring, the N-Queens Problem, and Circuit Board design. Also an implementation of a min-conflicts local search that is ideal for the N-Queens.

## Purpose

The general CSP definition alongisde the backtracking solver and its heuristsics were for my Artificial Intelligence class. The Circuit Board Problem was also required. However, the N-Queens and and the local search were extensions of my own.

## More information

More detailed information can be found in the .md or .pdf reports or in the code itself.
